# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### The overview of this project is to create a dataframe through JupyterNotebook showing a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.  We then used pandas and matplotlib to graph the weekly fares by city type
## Analysis
### To start off we imported and merged to .csv files and then looked at the different city types to compare and contrast them in an easy to read format.  By using the groupby function we were able to get each stastic in a dataframe for the urban, surburban, rural city type.  In the end we combined all the stastics into one dataframe to show everything. By quickly looking at the datarfame we created we can see that while the average fare per ride is higher for Suburban compared to rural, rural has a higher average fare per driver.  The graph that we created using matplotlib and pandas makes an easy to read and understand visual. The graph shows that Urban ride shares bring in a lot more fare than rural ride shares.  The urban ctities had by far more total rides than the other two city types.  With have the most total rides the Urban cities also had the most drivers and therfore most total fare collected. While for the for the rural and suburban cities the avg fare per driver is higher than average fare per ride, for urban cities the inverse is true, this shows that there are more drivers than rides in the urban cities, which we can see from looking at total drivers and total rides.

## Conclusion
### I think that this is a good method to show data in quickly and easy to digest format.  By using thesse methods we were able to showcase the stastics that we wanted to to show and manuever the data how we wanted.  Some recomendations that I have would be to increase the support of the rural areas as the fares are better than in the urban areas, also since the urban areas look very bloated, moving more opertions to the less urban areas could have some benifits.
