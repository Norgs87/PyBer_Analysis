# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
### The overview of this project is to create a dataframe through JuoyterNotebook showing a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.  We then used pandas and matplotlib to graph the weekly fares by city type
## Analysis
### To start off we imported and merged to .csv files and then looked at the different city types to compare and contrast them in an easy to read format.  By using the groupby function we were able to get each stastic in a dataframe for the urban, surburban, rural city type.  In the end we combined all the stastics into one dataframe to show everything. By quickly looking at the datarfame we created we can see that while the average fare per ride is higher for Suburban compared to rural, rural has a higher average fare per driver.  The graph that we created using matplotlib and pandas makes an easy to read and understand visual. The graph shows that Urban ride shares bring in a lot more fare than rural ride shares.
